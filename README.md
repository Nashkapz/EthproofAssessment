PURPOSE:
In this Solidity code we build a program used to understand how to create tokens. This program elaborates all the basic functionalities including contracts, conditionals, mappings and data 
types in Solidity.

FUNCTIONALITY:
In this program we build a contract named MyToken in which we created a token and described it's name and abbreviation and total supply provided and then mapped the address to the value as
balance. After that we minted the tokens and added the value to total supply and to the balance of the addresss. Atlast we created a function named burn which deducts the the value from total
supply as well as the balance if and only if the value is less than or equal to the balance.
